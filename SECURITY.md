# SEQ Token Security Audit and Fixes

## Overview

This repository contains the secure SEQ token implementation designed to prevent honeypot vulnerabilities commonly found in malicious tokens on the Base blockchain.

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hidden Minting Functions**
- **Problem**: Many honeypot tokens have hidden minting functions that only the owner can access, allowing unlimited token creation.
- **Solution**: Our SEQ token has a transparent `mint()` function with clear restrictions:
  - Only callable by owner
  - Cannot exceed MAX_SUPPLY (1 billion tokens)
  - Can be permanently disabled via `disableMinting()`

### 2. **Transfer Restrictions**
- **Problem**: Honeypot tokens often have hidden mechanisms to prevent specific users from selling/transferring.
- **Solution**: 
  - No blacklisting mechanisms
  - `canTransfer()` function always returns true for all addresses
  - Transparent transfer functions with no hidden restrictions

### 3. **Hidden Fees and Taxes**
- **Problem**: Malicious tokens can implement hidden taxes that drain user funds during transfers.
- **Solution**:
  - `getTransferTax()` always returns 0 (no taxes)
  - `getTransferAmount()` always returns the full amount
  - No hidden fee mechanisms in transfer functions

### 4. **Ownership Backdoors**
- **Problem**: Fake ownership renouncement where the owner retains control through hidden backdoors.
- **Solution**:
  - Standard OpenZeppelin Ownable implementation
  - `renounceOwnership()` permanently removes all owner privileges
  - `verifyNotHoneypot()` function shows current security status

### 5. **Reentrancy Attacks**
- **Problem**: Malicious contracts could exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities during transfers.
- **Solution**:
  - OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard protection on all transfer functions
  - Prevents recursive calls during token operations

## Contract Features

### Security Functions
- `verifyNotHoneypot()`: Returns security status and recommendations
- `canTransfer(address)`: Always returns true (no blacklisting)
- `getTransferTax()`: Always returns 0 (no hidden fees)
- `getTransferAmount(uint256)`: Returns full amount (no fee deduction)

### Owner Functions (Can be permanently removed)
- `mint()`: Mint new tokens (respects MAX_SUPPLY)
- `disableMinting()`: Permanently disable all future minting
- `renounceOwnership()`: Permanently remove all owner privileges

### Path to Full Decentralization
1. Deploy token with initial supply
2. Call `disableMinting()` to prevent any new token creation
3. Call `renounceOwnership()` to remove all owner privileges
4. Token is now fully decentralized and immutable

## Deployment Instructions

**Owner and ICO recipient wallet address example:**
- Owner: `0xf6b6F31737f8c42ebA6Ed06E624F08aC5a4e0FC0`
- ICO recipient: `0xf6b6F31737f8c42ebA6Ed06E624F08aC5a4e0FC0`

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Compile Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Security Tests
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to Base Network
<<<<<< copilot/fix-475d5eb4-e41b-4d24-b1e9-cf688310fe92
The SEQ Token requires three parameters for deployment:

1. **totalSupply**: Total number of tokens to create (500,000)
2. **owner**: 0xf6b6F31737f8c42ebA6Ed06E624F08aC5a4e0FC0
3. **ico**: Address to receive 90% of tokens


## Audit Results

✅ **No hidden minting functions**  
✅ **No transfer restrictions or blacklisting**  
✅ **No hidden fees or taxes**  
✅ **No ownership backdoors**  
✅ **Reentrancy protection enabled**  
✅ **Transparent and verifiable functions**  
✅ **Path to full decentralization availab
This token implementation prioritizes security and transparency. Users should always verify contract code on block explorers
